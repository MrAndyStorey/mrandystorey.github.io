# Welcome

After years working in IT, I am now training to be a Computer Science Teacher with [WSTP](https://www.wessexschools.uk/).

I’ve enjoyed a varied career, in both the public and private sector, with numerous technical and soft skills that I feel are transferable into teaching.  

Here's hoping that I can inspire pupils into digital careers that I have gained so much from.

## Book
Incredibly, inbetween Open University assignments, full time work and a young family I got involved in writing a hardback book about the history of cycling jerseys and clothing.  Over the years, I built up a decent collection of cycle jerseys many of which I've now sold to clear up some space, which I published via a website (my final year Open University project) that was then made into a real-life book thanks to the Octopus Publishing Group published in May 2016.

The [Art of the Jersey](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Art-Jersey-Celebration-Cycling-Racing/dp/1784721662/) celebrates the jersey’s changing styles and trends and features over 200 jerseys with each one having a a photograph along with a key information telling the jersey's story.
