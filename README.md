# Welcome

After years working in IT, I am now training to be a Computer Science Teacher with [WSTP](https://www.wessexschools.uk/).

Iâ€™ve enjoyed a varied career, in both the public and private sector, with numerous technical and soft skills that I feel are transferable into teaching.  

Here's hoping that I can inspire pupils into digital careers that I have gained so much from.
