# Welcome to mrandystorey.github.io

After years working in IT, I am now training to be a Computer Science Teacher with [WSTP](https://www.wessexschools.uk/).

Iâ€™ve had a varied career, in both the public and private sector, with numerous technical and social skills that I feel are transferable into teaching.  

Here's hoping that I can inspire pupils into digital careers which I myself have gained so much from.
